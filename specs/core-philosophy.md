# Mari — Core Philosophy

## The Problem with Traditional Time Tracking

Most time trackers treat logging as a task. Start a timer. Stop the timer. Forgot to start? Reconstruct your day from memory. Forgot to stop? Your "quick email check" now shows 4 hours.

This creates two failure modes:

1. **Abandonment** — The overhead isn't worth the insight
2. **Anxiety** — Time tracking becomes another thing to manage

Mari rejects both.

## The Insight

You already know what you're working on. You just need a system that asks occasionally and listens for the answer.

Most of the time, the answer is: "Same thing as before."

That answer should cost nothing.

## Core Principles

### 1. Silence is Confirmation

If you're heads-down coding and a prompt appears, doing nothing means "yes, still coding." Time is logged. Prompt disappears. You never left your flow.

Traditional model: 16 clicks during 4 hours of deep work.
Mari model: 0 interactions.

### 2. Switching is the Exception

The only time you need to act is when context changes. New task? Type it. Taking a break? Hit Escape. The interface is optimized for the uncommon case, not the common one.

### 3. Editor, Not Approver

Time tracking is happening whether you engage or not. Your role shifts from _approving every entry_ to _correcting the rare mistake_. Most days, there's nothing to correct.

### 4. Small Errors, Easy Fixes

The worst case is 15 minutes misattributed. That's fixable in the activity log with two clicks. Compare this to reconstructing a full day from memory because you forgot to start a timer.

We optimize for recovery, not prevention.

### 5. Duration Over Timestamps

Mari doesn't care that you worked on "Development" from 9:07 to 10:23. It cares that you spent 3 hours on it today.

This maps to how humans think about time ("I spent the morning on the report") and simplifies everything: data model, editing, exports.

### 6. Respect the User's Attention

Prompts are small, predictable, and fast to dismiss. They appear in the same place every time. They don't steal focus from fullscreen apps. They don't stack up.

If the user is already managing their time (activity log is open), prompts suppress entirely. We don't remind people who are already paying attention.

## What Mari Is Not

- **Not a project management tool** — No deadlines, no assignments, no team features
- **Not a billing system** — Export your data; invoice however you want
- **Not a surveillance tool** — No screenshots, no app tracking, no "productivity scores"

Mari answers one question: _Where did my time go?_

---

## The Promise

Time tracking should feel like checking the weather, not filing taxes.

You glance at it. You already know roughly what it'll say. Occasionally you note something interesting. Then you move on with your day.

That's Mari.
